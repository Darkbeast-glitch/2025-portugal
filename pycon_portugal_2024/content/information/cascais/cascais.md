Cascais is the premier holiday destination of the Portuguese Riviera, as well as being a fascinating town to visit as a day trip from Lisbon.
Situated on a coastline of beautiful sandy beaches, it has been responsibly developed into a vibrant resort town, while retaining its traditional and charming Portuguese character.

Historically, Cascais was the summer retreat of the Portuguese nobility, and today the town displays an elegant fusion of its regal and fishing heritage, combined with the facilities expected by modern tourists.
Found within the cobbled streets of its historic centre are grand 19th-century villas, an imposing fort and fascinating museums, along with a variety of lively bars and outstanding restaurants. All of these combine to give the town a buzzing atmosphere, making it a wonderful holiday location.

Cascais boasts so many interesting sights and attractions that it is regarded as one of the best day trips from Lisbon.
The beaches of Cascais are glorious. Surrounding the town are the beautiful beaches of the Portuguese Riviera, while to the north lies the wild and dramatic scenery of the Serra de Sintra coastline, with its vast surfing beaches and towering cliffs.
Cascais is so much more than just a beach holiday destination. Just a short train ride takes you to the centre of vibrant Lisbon, and to the north lies the town of Sintra, with its whimsical palaces and cooling hills.
