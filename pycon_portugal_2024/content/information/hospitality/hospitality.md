## ChildCare

Childcare at Pycon Portugal and tech conferences are essential factors that help folks who otherwise may not be able to attend. We want to make sure that parents feel welcome bringing their children to Pycon Portugal and that the availability of childcare is not a barrier to attending.

The Childcare Application Opening will be on April 1st. The closing date for Childcare will be on May 5th, 23:59 UTC.
We look forward to seeing you - and your kids - soon in Cascais!
